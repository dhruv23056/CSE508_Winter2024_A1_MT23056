### 1. Preprocessing:

**Overview:**
Preprocessing is a fundamental step in text data preparation, aimed at refining and organizing raw textual information before further analysis. It involves a series of operations to enhance the quality and relevance of the data.

**Tasks within Preprocessing:**
- **Tokenization:** Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Lowercasing:** Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
- **Removing Stopwords:** Eliminating common words that don't contribute significantly to the meaning.
- **Stemming or Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or root form to capture the core meaning.


### 2. Unigram Indexing:

**Overview:**
Unigram indexing involves creating an index of individual words present in the text corpus. This process establishes a mapping between each unique word and the documents where it appears.

**Tasks within Unigram Indexing:**
- **Term Frequency (TF):** Counting the occurrences of each term in a document.
- **Inverted Document Frequency (IDF):** Calculating the importance of a term across the entire document collection.
- **Creating Unigram Index:** Associating each term with the documents it appears in.

### 3. Positional Indexing:

**Overview:**
Positional indexing extends the concept of unigram indexing by considering the positions of terms within documents. This allows for more precise retrieval and analysis, particularly useful for tasks such as phrase searching.

**Tasks within Positional Indexing:**
- **Recording Term Positions:** Storing the positions of each term within a document.
- **Constructing Positional Index:** Creating a mapping of terms to their positions in documents.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the three tasks - preprocessing, unigram indexing, and positional indexing - form a comprehensive pipeline for preparing and structuring text data. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of subsequent analysis but also provides a foundation for advanced information retrieval techniques.
